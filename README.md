# Building Level AlphaEarth Analysis

A comprehensive tutorial for extracting and analysing Google's AlphaEarth Foundations satellite embeddings at the building level, using Liverpool City Region as a case study.

## Overview

This repository demonstrates how to leverage Google's AlphaEarth Foundations AI model to analyse urban environments through satellite embeddings. The tutorial progresses from basic data extraction through advanced predictive modeling, combining satellite AI with urban datasets to identify building typologies and predict characteristics.

## What are AlphaEarth Embeddings?

[AlphaEarth Foundations](https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/alphaearth-foundations-helps-map-our-planet-in-unprecedented-detail/) is an AI model developed by Google DeepMind that provides pre-computed embeddings. These numerical "fingerprints" aim to capture the visual characteristics of locations. These embeddings distil complex environmental information into 64 numerical values for every 10Ã—10 meter pixel across Earth's terrestrial and coastal zones.

## Prerequisites

### Required Libraries
```bash
pip install earthengine-api pyarrow scikit-learn pandas geopandas clustergram keplergl umap-learn seaborn matplotlib numpy requests pillow duckdb plotly
```

### Google Earth Engine Account
You will need a Google Account to access the AlphaEarth data through Google Earth Engine.

## Data

All data for this tutorial is available from the Geographic Data Service and should be placed in a `data` folder in your working directory.

## Key Findings

### Cluster Analysis
The analysis identified five distinct building types:
- **Cluster A**: Mixed residential from 1950s-1960s
- **Cluster B**: Detached and semi-detached properties
- **Cluster C**: Victorian/Edwardian terraces (pre-1930)
- **Cluster D**: High-density residential (terraced housing)
- **Cluster E**: Large specialised buildings (industrial/commercial)

### Predictive Performance
The Random Forest model achieved 49% accuracy in predicting building age across 9 time periods, with notable patterns:
- Best performance on 1900-1929 buildings (70% recall)
- Systematic confusion between adjacent time periods
- Challenges distinguishing mid-to-late 20th century buildings
